            <h1>Add Redirect</h1>
            <p>Note: Redirects will not take effect until restart of the Flask application.</p>
            <p> Also, do not include domain in redirect paths, use only root-relative paths.</p>
            <p> Finally, be careful creating 301 redirects, they should never point to another redirect!</p>
