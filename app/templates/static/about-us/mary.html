					<p class="Cultivar_p">
						My fascination with plants began as early as I can remember, stemming from my two grandmothers: one a botanist who focused her studies on California wildflowers, and the other a lifelong vegetable gardener in the challenging New England climate. My parents nurtured my botanical interests by planting huge vegetable gardens and always encouraging my curiosity.
					</p>
					<p class="Cultivar_p">
						My husband and I share a 1/4 acre back yard where we grow way too many veggies every year (mostly tomatoes, cucumbers, and spicy peppers). Weâ€™ve tucked fruit trees in here and there, and flowers definitely have their place (all over the place); salvia, sunflowers, cosmos,zinnias, dahlias, and many fairly rambunctious hardy annuals (some of my absolute favorites: borage, nasturtiums, and love-in-the mist).
					</p>
					<p class="Cultivar_p">
						Besides digging in the dirt, I also love
						cooking (especially Mexican food), reading (mostly novels and mysteries, but I have been known to spend an hour in the dictionary), canning (especially salsa),the wild northern California coast, cats, and traveling to new and familiar places. Fun fact about me: I have an identical twin sister who is also a plant nerd.
