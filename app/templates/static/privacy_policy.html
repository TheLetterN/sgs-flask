				<h1>
					Privacy Policy
				</h1>
				<h2>
					Information Collection And Use
				</h2>
				<p>
					Swallowtail Garden Seeds is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information. Swallowtail Garden Seeds collects information from our customers at several different points on our website for order fulfillment. It is our company policy to keep our customerâ€™s personal information private.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Orders
				</h2>
				<p>
					We request information from the customer on our order form. Here a customer must provide contact information like name and shipping address. This information is used to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used only to get in touch with the customer.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Security SSL Encryption
				</h2>
				<p>
					This website takes every precaution to protect our customers' information. When customers submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					When our registration/order form asks customers to enter sensitive information, that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.
					While on a secure page, such as our order form, you will see the URL changes from http to https. The 's' stands for secure. In some cases you will also see a padlock icon in the address bar or bottom of a browser window such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect customer-information off-line. All of our customers' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to
					<a href="mailto:info@swallowtailgardenseeds.com">
						info@swallowtailgardenseeds.com
					</a>
					.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Links
				</h2>
				<p>
					Our website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Swallowtail Garden Seeds, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our customers to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Website.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Correction/Updating Personal Information
				</h2>
				<p>
					If a customer's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a customer no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that customer's personal data provided to us. This can usually be done by emailing our Customer Support at
					<a href="mailto:info@swallowtailgardenseeds.com">
						info@swallowtailgardenseeds.com
					</a>
					, or call us at 1-877-489-7333.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Our Internet Privacy Policy
				</h2>
				<p>
					This Internet Privacy Policy is effective as January 1, 2001. We do not sell customer information. Our company policy is to keep our customer's personal information private.
					<br/>
					If you would like to make changes to your account or if you have any questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please call us at 1-877-489-7333 or send an email to Customer Support at
