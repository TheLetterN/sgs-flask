				<p>
					Whether we’re in the garden or anywhere else, we try not to take life too seriously, and thought you might like to see a bit more of our silly side. We’ve compiled a list of our favorite garden-related humor, along with some quotes that make us smile. We hope you do, too. Feel free to let the overripe tomatoes fly!

				<h2>
					Wise Words about the Garden
				</h2>
				<p>
					"In every gardener there is a child who believes in The Seed Fairy."
					<span>
						-Robert Brault
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					"Flowers always make people better, happier, and more helpful; they are sunshine, food and medicine for the soul."
					<span>
						-Luther Burbank
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					"Everything that slows us down and forces patience, everything that sets us back into the slow circles of nature, is a help. Gardening is an instrument of grace."
					<span>
						-May Sarton
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					"What is a weed? A plant whose virtues have never been discovered."
					<span>
						-Ralph Waldo Emerson
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					"A garden is a grand teacher. It teaches patience and careful watchfulness; it teaches industry and thrift; above all it teaches entire trust."
					<span>
						-Gertrude Jekyll
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					"Weeds are flowers too, once you get to know them."
					<span>
						-A.A. Milne
					</span>

					"Anyone who thinks that gardening begins in the spring and ends in the fall is missing the best part of the whole year; for gardening begins in January with the dream."
					<span>
						-Josephine Nuese, American author of The Country Garden
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					"For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes. To someone who doesn’t understand growth, it would look like complete destruction."
					<span>
						-Cynthia Occello
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					"The philosopher who said that work well done never needs doing over never weeded a garden."
					<span>
						-Ray D. Everson
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					"There are no gardening mistakes, just experiments."
					<span>
						-Janet Kilburn Phillips, landscaper and author
					</span>

					<span>
						-Greek proverb
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					"I must have flowers, always and always."
					<span>
						-Claude Monet
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					"The men of experiment are like the ant; they only collect and use. But the bee . . . gathers its materials from the flowers of the garden and of the field, but transforms and digests it by a power of its own."
					<span>
						-Leonardo DaVinci

I’m going to take my clothes off right now and streak through that stupid flower show!” As fast as she could, she fumbled her way out of her clothes and, completely naked, ran through the front door of the flower show. Waiting outside, her friend soon heard a huge commotion inside the hall, followed by loud applause. The naked lady burst out through the door surrounded by a cheering crowd."What happened?" asked her waiting friend."I just won first prize for Best Dried Arrangement!"
