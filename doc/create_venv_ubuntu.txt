Instructions for creating virtual enviromnent in Ubuntu 14.04:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS: As of writing this document (June 6, 2015) Ubuntu 14.04 has a slightly broken
version of pyvenv-3.4, so you will need to follow these instructions to 
correctly set up your virtual environment:

1. In a terminal, navigate to the project's directory. For example, if the 
project is “sgs_flask” in your Documents folder:
    cd ~/Documents/sgs_flask
2. Run this command:
    pyvenv-3.4 --without-pip venv
3. Activate the virtual environment:
    source venv/bin/activate
4. Download the pip installer:
    wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
5. Run the pip installer:
    python get-pip.py
6. Once installed, you can (and should) delete get-pip.py
7. Deactivate the virtual environment with this command:
    deactivate
8. Congratulations, you should now have a working Python 3 virtual environment!
9. See using_venv.txt for instructions on using your virtual environment.

Ubuntu 15.04: This will probably work for future versions of Ubuntu as well:

1. Install python3-venv:
    sudo apt-get install python3-venv
2. Navigate to project directory in a terminal.
    cd /path/to/sgs_flask
3. Create the virtual environment with pyvenv:
    pyvenv venv
4. Congratulations, you should now have a working Python 3 virtual environment.
5. See using_venv.txt for instructions on using your virtual environment.
