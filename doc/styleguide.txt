Style Guide for SGS Flask

General:

- Please follow the PEP8 style guide, and run flake8 on any python files you
  you edit before committing them to the repository.
- Where not otherwise specified, arrange classes, attributes, methods, and top-
  level functions alphabetically.
- Try to follow Google's style guide when writing docstrings. Sphinx's docs
  include good examples: http://sphinx-doc.org/latest/ext/example_google.html

Classes:

- Magic methods (special Python methods such as __init__ or __repr__) should
  always be after other methods.

Database Models:

- Local data attributes come first, followed by relationships and foreign keys.
- Association tables should end with _association.

Tests:

- Tests should be split into files based on which file they are testing.
- setUp and tearDown methods should always come first.
- Unit tests and other fast tests that don't utilize the database should go in
  tests/fast_tests/ while tests involving the database belong in 
  tests/database_tests/
