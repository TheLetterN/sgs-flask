To install the modules needed for our Flask project:

1. Navigate to sgs_flask in a terminal:
    cd /path/to/sgs_flask
2. Activate the virtual environment:
    source venv/bin/activate
3. Install modules with pip:
    pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy flask-login flake8 pytest flask-script \
    flask-migrate flask-wtf flask-mail itsdangerous coverage python-slugify
Or you may install the exact versions of the modules used by running:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Optionally, you should consider installing the ipython shell, which is nicer
    Python shell than the default: pip install ipython

I recommend installing the latest versions of the modules used, ideally, but
if anything goes wrong with the latest versions, requirements.txt has a known
working setup.

Explanation of each module:

flask -- Flask, the microframework at the base of our web application.
flask-sqlalchemy -- Integrates the SQLAlchemy module (which is automatically
    installed as a pre-requisite) into Flask to allow us to easily make and
    use database modules.
flask-login -- Flask module to make user authentication and access restriction
    easier for us to manage.
flake8  -- Runnable module to check our code for PEP8 compliance and some other
    clean code practices. It is recommended to run this on any python file you
    create or edit.
pytest -- Testing module py.test.
flask-script -- Allows us to use manage.py to run various aspects of our app.
