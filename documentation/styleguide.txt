Style Guide for SGS Flask

General:

- Please follow the PEP8 style guide, and run flake8 on any python files you
  you edit before committing them to the repository.
- Where not otherwise specified, arrange classes, attributes, methods, and top-
  level functions alphabetically.
- Top-level functions should be defined after classes.
- Try to follow Google's style guide when writing docstrings. Sphinx's docs
  include good examples: http://sphinx-doc.org/latest/ext/example_google.html

Classes:

- Magic methods (special Python methods such as __init__ or __repr__) should
  always be before other methods.
- Properties should come directly after magic methods.
- Static methods and class methods come after properties.
- Normal methods come last.
- Data attributes should usually be alphabetical, but if they logically fit
  into subgroups, they should be arranged by subgroup alphabetically (begin
  each subgroup with a comment stating the subgroup's name) and then
  alphabetically within each subgroup.

Database Models:

- The primary key should always be the first attribute.
- Relationships should follow the rules of class attributes.
- Backrefs should be documented in the docstrings of classes they point to.
- Association tables should end with _association.

Tests:

- Tests should be split into files based on which file they are testing.
- setUp and tearDown methods should always come first.
- Helper methods within test classes (that don't begin with test) should come
  before test methods.
- Unit tests and other fast tests that don't utilize the database should go in
  tests/fast_tests/ while tests involving the database belong in 
  tests/database_tests/
