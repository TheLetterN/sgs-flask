To install the modules needed for our Flask project:

1. Navigate to sgs_flask in a terminal:
    cd /path/to/sgs_flask
2. Activate the virtual environment:
    source venv/bin/activate
3. Install modules with pip:
    pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy flask-login
Or you may install the exact versions of the modules used by running:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

I recommend installing the latest versions of the modules used, ideally, but
if anything goes wrong with the latest versions, requirements.txt has a known
working setup.
