Style Guide for SGS Flask

General:

- Please follow the PEP8 style guide, and run flake8 on any python files you
  you edit before committing them to the repository.
- Where not otherwise specified, arrange classes, attributes, methods, and top-
  level functions alphabetically.

Classes:

- Magic methods (special Python methods such as __init__ or __repr__) should
  always be after other methods.

Database Models:

- Local data attributes come first, followed by relationships and foreign keys.

Unit Tests:

- Unit tests should be split into files based on which file they are testing.
- setUp and tearDown methods should always come first.
