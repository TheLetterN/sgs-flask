All of our Python libraries should be installed in our virtual environment,
rather than being installed system-wide. As such, we need to run our project
from the virtual environment we previously set up. To do so:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory in it. Example:
    cd ~/Documents/sgs_flask
2. Activate the virtual enviromnent:
    source venv/bin/activate

This way, all python-related commands and scripts you run from this terminal
will use what's installed in the virtual environment rather than using the
versions installed system-wide.

When finished working, you should deactivate the virtual environment:
    deactivate

That's about all there is to it; remember to always make sure you're in the
virtual environment when installing modules with pip, otherwise it will try
to install them system-wide, and fail! You can tell you're in the virtual
environment when your shell is prefixed with: (venv)
